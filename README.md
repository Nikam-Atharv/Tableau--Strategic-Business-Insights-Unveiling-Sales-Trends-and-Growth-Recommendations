# Tableau---Strategic-Business-Insights-Unveiling-Sales-Trends-and-Growth-Recommendations


Successfully completed an end-to-end visualization project as part of the Tableau Analytics and Visualization challenge, replicating the 2017 dataset. Leveraged three interconnected datasets to conduct exploratory data analysis, uncovering sales and revenue trends over the years across various demographics such as categories and locations. The project involved meticulous analysis of the provided glossary for dataset details and integration of an additional MSA dataset for precise location identification. Developed a comprehensive Tableau packaged workbook featuring a storyboard with visually compelling worksheets and dashboards, highlighting significant trends and factors influencing sales and revenue. The final slide of the storyboard presents top 3 strategic recommendations for business growth in the upcoming years, substantiated by the insights derived from the visualizations and analysis.
